# nuclei_find
This toolkit enables the detection of nuclei in low resolution images through the use of a novel computer vision workflow. Nuclei can also be clustered to given coordinates enabling the spatial quantification of cells. The purpsoe of this workflow's development was to enable the clustering of cells in whole slide images of embryos.
